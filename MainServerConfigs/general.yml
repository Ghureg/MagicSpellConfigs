        lore:
          - "&bA translation of one of the many scolls of the Historyan"
        pages:
          - |
            This is a copy of an original scroll, The original was written in old runes, so some translations may be off. This was translated by a schooler by the college of fahnel. The original was written in gold runes, of which seemed to keep changing in front of me.
          - |
            If you are here to learn of spells that are rair or of power, you are reading the wrong scroll. But rather of the power they could posses, to tell of how they come about and how our world was created.
          - |
            In the first chapter of our world the children of the Great Creator each were given extraordinary power of one of the nine elements of magic. They each had the ability of a type of magic that no mortal will ever be able to possess: Creation magic.
          - |
            Each child held the ability to create within their element, extraordinary things, Lakes, mountains, volcanoes, they could shape the world in their image.
          - |
            The Great Creator also created people for his children to govern over, mortals. elves, dwarves, gnomes, goblins, kobolds, and more, but that is another story. Sadly after the Great Hatching, where the children were brought into the world,
          - |
            and magic was given to some mortals, Some of the children were possessed by lust over their power.Wanting more, they began to wage wars with one another, but as it is with immortals, they could never win,
          - |
            nor lose. So in turn they began to punish those they were given. The mortals began to suffer under the rain of the divines.
          - |
            Most of the nine chose to destroy rather than create, as their father had intended. After hundreds of years a young mortal rose, but she had an odd power, she had the ability of using creation magic.
          - |
            The divines saw her as a challenge to their power and saw it fit to destroy her. Not much is known about her, but it was said that she created a plan to better the lives of the mortal people. She became known as the Mother Seer.
          - |
            For she had laid out the future for hundreds of years. She had created a prophecy of the end of the divines as they had ruled. Some legends tell of a tail of a Fortress of prophecy, a mountain that was so thick that no beast, mortal or immortal could
          - |
            find, let alone enter unless they were given access, or belonged to a part of the prophecy that were engraved in runes along its walls. Years later rumors and scrolls emerged from this mountain telling stories of death, ruin, great battles, and heroes,
          - |
            all of which became true. I can tell for a fact that this fortress is real for this is where i reside now. Now this is where I come into play. I am the Historian, how I came to be, How I exist for so long, and how i can speak every
          - |
            language, i don not know. But it is my job to watch, listen and record all events that has, have, is, and will. I have been given a tool of more power than ever. I have been given a quill with the power to record, and tell a tail.
          - |
            My predecessor had change something, but he never could have imagined the repercussions of what would happen. It destroyed him, consumed him into a void, but this is how i came to know all of what has already been said, from his scrolls and books.

          - |
            Each of us living in our youth until we are no longer the historian then all at once, within a day every moon we have seen catches up to our age. But that is enough about me. For the events I am meant to write is about the downfall of the divines.
          - |
            With me telling you that, I shall continue with what i have been told to record. Eighteen Hundred years after the loss of the Mother Seer, a man rose from the crowds, he too had the ability of creation.
          - |
            But he did not have the ability to philosophy. He soon became known as the maker of magic, for he trained nine mortals in the art of creation, but each only in a specific element. Eventually they became masters in each element of magic, being the first masters.
          - |
            The maker of magic and the masters trapped each divine into the bodys of the masters, linking their soul to that of the divines. taming and giving the divines mortality. The masters were blessed with unusually long lives, but
          - |
            eventually they grew old. Each master must pick an apprentice and teach them the art of their element, so that when they die, the soul of the divine wis passed on to the new master. The first death of a master came as a shock to everyone.
          - |
            But within eight minutes, all the masters had died, and so each master, as soon as they are chosen must pick an apprentice, otherwise they risk releasing the divines wrath on all. Some of the divines that had been kind to mortals, such as arcane,
          - |
            let it happen and betters the worlds of mortals with a true linked spirit. While others, such as darkness, is in pain constantly because their souls are constantly battling within the void. The rest is written on the minds of the people
          - |
            as legends for it is the end of may story. For only the masters will ever know the specifics of what has happened to their predecessors. The maker of magic also drifted into legend, and it is unknown what truly happened to him.
